    <title>Different Types Of Character Encoding</title>
</head>
<body>
    Certainly, there are various character encodings used to represent different
    character sets and languages. Here are some common character encodings and
    the types of characters they support:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit): </b>
        <p>
          UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding that supports the entire Unicode
          character set, which includes characters from almost all languages and
          scripts in the world. It is the most widely used character encoding
          for multilingual content and is the default for many web pages.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>UTF-16 (Unicode Transformation Format 16-bit): </b>
        <p>
          UTF-16 is another Unicode encoding, but it uses 16 bits for each
          character. It's suitable for representing characters from the entire
          Unicode range and is often used in software applications and for
          processing text that includes complex scripts.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1): </b>
        <p>
          ISO-8859-1 is a character encoding that primarily supports Western
          European languages. It includes characters for languages like English,
          French, Spanish, and German but lacks support for characters from
          other scripts.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>ISO-8859-7 (Greek): </b>
        <p>
          ISO-8859-7 is designed specifically for the Greek language and
          includes characters and diacritics used in the Greek alphabet.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> Shift JIS (Shift Japanese Industrial Standards): </b>
        <p>
          Shift JIS is a character encoding used for the Japanese language. It
          includes characters and symbols needed for writing in Japanese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> EUC-KR (Extended Unix Code-KR): </b>
        <p>
          EUC-KR is a character encoding for the Korean language, primarily used
          in South Korea. It includes characters needed for writing in Korean.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> Big5: </b>
        <p>
          Big5 is a character encoding primarily used for traditional Chinese
          characters. It's common in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> UTF-7: </b>
        <p>
          UTF-7 is a simplified version of Unicode encoding used for email and
          other text data transmission. It supports a limited character set and
          is less common for web content.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Windows-1252: </b>
        <p>
          Windows-1252 is an extension of ISO-8859-1 and is commonly used for
          encoding text in Western European languages. It includes characters
          for languages such as English, French, and Spanish.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> ISO-2022-JP (Japanese): </b>
        <p>
          ISO-2022-JP is used for encoding Japanese text and includes characters
          and escape sequences for switching between different character sets
          within the same document.
