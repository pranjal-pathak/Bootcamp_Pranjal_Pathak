        <h2>The OSI Model: Understanding Network Communication</h2>
        <p>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize network communication. It consists of seven layers, each with a specific role in the process of data transmission and reception.</p>
        
        <h2>Layer 1: Physical Layer</h2>
        <p>The Physical Layer deals with the actual transmission of raw data over physical media. It involves specifications for cables, connectors, and electrical/optical signals.</p>
        
        <h2>Layer 2: Data Link Layer</h2>
        <p>The Data Link Layer manages data frames, addressing, and error detection. It ensures data integrity and controls access to the physical medium.</p>
        
        <h2>Layer 3: Network Layer</h2>
        <p>The Network Layer handles routing, addressing, and logical addressing. It allows data packets to be transmitted between different networks.</p>
        
        <h2>Layer 4: Transport Layer</h2>
        <p>The Transport Layer manages end-to-end communication, error detection, and flow control. It ensures reliable data transfer between devices.</p>
        
        <h2>Layer 5: Session Layer</h2>
        <p>The Session Layer establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions. It manages dialog control and synchronization.</p>
        
        <h2>Layer 6: Presentation Layer</h2>
        <p>The Presentation Layer deals with data format translation, encryption, and compression. It ensures that data is presented in a readable format.</p>
        
        <h2>Layer 7: Application Layer</h2>
        <p>The Application Layer provides network services directly to end-users. It includes protocols for various applications like email, web browsing, and file transfer.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Layer 1 to Layer 4 are primarily concerned with data transport.</li>
            <li>Layer 5 to Layer 7 focus on data representation and user interaction.</li>
        </ul>
