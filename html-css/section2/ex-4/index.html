    <!-- Paragraph describing the purpose of the viewport meta tag -->
    <p>The <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag with the attribute <code>name="viewport"</code> is used to define the viewport settings for a web page, ensuring that the page is displayed correctly and responsively on various devices, including mobile phones and tablets. The <code>content</code> attribute specifies that the page should adapt to the device's screen width (<code>width=device-width</code>) and start with an initial zoom level of 1.0 (<code>initial-scale=1.0</code>). This tag is essential for providing a consistent and user-friendly experience across different screen sizes.</p>
