    <p>
      When designing the Ancient Scripts Archive, we've chosen a custom charset
      that aligns with the specific ancient scripts we're presenting. In this
      case, we've set the charset to "ISO-8859-8," which is designed for the
      Hebrew script. This choice is essential for accurately rendering the
      unique characters and symbols found in ancient Hebrew texts. By using this
      custom charset, we ensure that the website's content is displayed in a way
      that reflects the historical and cultural significance of the scripts,
      making it easier for our visitors to engage with and appreciate the beauty
      of these ancient writing systems.
