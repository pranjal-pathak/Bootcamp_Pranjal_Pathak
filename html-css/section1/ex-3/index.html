    <p>
      UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit) is a character encoding
      standard that supports a vast range of characters, including those from
      different languages, scripts, and cuisines worldwide. For a "Global Recipe
      Hub" website, the use of UTF-8 charset is essential for several reasons:
    </p>
    <li>
      Multilingual Support : Recipes come from various countries and regions,
      each with its unique set of characters and special symbols. UTF-8 ensures
      that all characters, whether it's accents in French recipes, special
      characters in Asian scripts, or uniquevsymbols in regional cuisines, are
      accurately displayed. This means that users from around the world can
      access and share recipes in their native languages without encountering
      issues related to character rendering.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cultural Inclusivity: A global recipe website celebrates diversity and
      cultural exchange. UTF-8 promotes inclusivity by allowing the presentation
      of recipes with their authentic names,ingredients, and descriptions. Users
      can explore and appreciate the culinary heritage of different regions
      without losing the cultural nuances.
