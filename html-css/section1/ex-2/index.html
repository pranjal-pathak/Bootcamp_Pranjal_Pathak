    <h3>Explanation of the viewport meta tag:</h3>
    <p>
        The viewport meta tag is essential for creating a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes and devices. It includes the following attributes:
        <li>width=device-width : This attribute ensures that the webpage's width matches the width of the device's screen, allowing content to scale appropriately.
        <li>initial-scale=1.0 : The initial-scale attribute sets the initial zoom level of the webpage to 1.0, ensuring that the webpage is initially displayed at its original size, which is optimal for readability and user experience.
