1) What does it take to be a good web developer?
    From what I understand about web developemnt
    - Broadly it is problem solving, so we need to be ready to find solutions to every obstacle     that comes during the process of building
    - There is no end to learning
    - And it's important to accept that we cannot remeber eevrything or cannot know everything so it's important to treat the search engines and AI tools as our friend and gather information from them whenever required, it's important to know what to google rather than the actual stuff
    - Also to be a good web developer, it's important to build simple and intutive UI, so that's something which should be focused on

2) Current state as a Web Developer?
    - I started working projects using Vanilla JavaScript and later moved on to Recat
    - I have build projects such as Task Manager, Social Media Feed, Bookmarking apps which had all the CRUD features as well as used the FireStore DB
    - The problem that I'm facing right now is that I haven't written any JS code in a couple of months (reason being, I was trying to learn SpringBoot) because of which things have started to appear a bit alien at the moment
